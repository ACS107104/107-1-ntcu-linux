	## Q1 via systemd to administrate two sshd, set the port of second sshd into 2222. confirm if both sshd service has been initiated by trying out the following commands  netstat -alntp | grep ssh   
	### procedure   
	 - use netstat -alntp to check out the current condition of connection   
	 - use systemctl start sshd to initiate the service of sshd   
	 - and then use netstat -alntp to check if sshd is used   
	 - cd /etc is inputted to switch directory  
	 - 用confirm if directory /etc include the archive with order ll | grep ssh  
	 - transfer into 轉進去 ssh archive using cd /etc/ssh  
	 - use cp sshd_config sshd2_config to copy the contents into new file    
	 - vi sshd2_config is used for file edition 
	 - change the port   
	 - fnd the order to download semanage using yum provides semanage   
	 - install the order with yum install policycoreutils-python     
	 - try duplicate the file with cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service sshd2.service   
	 - change the contents with vi sshd2.service   
	 - initiate service of sshd using systemctl start sshd2.service   
	 - restart the file using systemctl daemon-reload  
	 - and then initiate the service of sshd2 again using systemctl start sshd2.service  
	 - finf out what the question is asking for by netstat -alntp | grep ssh this command.
